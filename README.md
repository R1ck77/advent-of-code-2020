# advent-of-code-2020

My solutions for the "Advent of code 2020" (https://adventofcode.com/), in Clojure.

_Most of the time_ I fought for "decency" instead of coding or execution speed (but performance got an eye of regard), yet I'm the first to recognize that there is much that could be improved.

I'm not much of a Clojure/LISP coder, so don't take this repository as exemplifying anything.

## Usage

    lein run

will provide all the solutions for the inputs in the "resources" folder, but you can also crunch a single problem, e.g.:

    lein run 17

to run day 17.

You can replace the files in the resources to solve other problems, hopefully (I didn't test other problem inputs, so I can't be 100% sure that my solutions are general, although I strived for them to be), or use the REPL to run specific inputs (the code should be clear enough. Most of the time).
